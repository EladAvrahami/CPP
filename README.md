# helloWorld of C++

<h3>Hello wrold section </h3>
input output print string and int to consol


<h3>Section 3 </h3>
<pre>  
crtegories of control statment:
sequential - Like js line by line.
selection - execution according to if else.
repetition - loops

</pre>


<h3>Section 4 - Arrays and Vectors</h3>
<pre> 
STL - Standard Template Library
araryand vector templates classes are part of the Standard Template Library
built-in array
array class
Vectors - like array but can be resize as more elemts are added to them(no need spesify initial capacity)
methods :
front - return front elemnt
back -  back elemnt
pop_back - remove the last element of the vector
push_back -enter val to last elemnt of vector
insert - give spesice location to add vector
being - first vector element


data strucctres - containers that hold many elemnts like vector or array
</pre>


<h3>Section 5 - FUNCTIONS </h3>
<pre>  
function prototypes - declare function before main but define it after main (42)
function defenition - describe what it does
parameter pass by val &by ref
variable scope (inside fun) and lifetime (global val declare above main)
static - combination between global and local variable
functions overloading -same name diffrent types or parameter
-------------
Cmath Library:
sqrt-finding square root.
pow- finding base taken to a power
celi-rounding value up to nearest int
floor-rounding value down to nearest int

-------------
recursion-when function call itself
